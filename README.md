  "cameras": [
    {
      "name": "Camera Name",
      "videoConfig": {
      	"source": "-re -i rtsp://myfancy_rtsp_stream",

    }
  ]
}

## Uploading to Google Drive of Still Images ( Snapshots )

This is an optional feature that will automatically store every snapshot taken to your Google Drive account as a photo.  This is very useful if you have motion sensor in the same room as the camera, as it will take a snapshot of whatever caused the motion sensor to trigger, and store the image on Google Drive and create a Picture Notification on your iOS device.

The snaphots are stored in a folder called "Camera Pictures", and are named with camera name, date and time of the image.

To enable this feature, please add a new config option "uploader", and follow the steps below.

* Add the option "uploader" to your config.json i.e.

```
{
  "platform": "Camera-ffmpeg",
  "cameras": [
    {
      "name": "Camera Name",
      "uploader": true,
      "videoConfig": {
      	"source": "-re -i rtsp://myfancy_rtsp_stream",
        "stillImageSource": "-i http://faster_still_image_grab_url/this_is_optional.jpg",
      	"maxStreams": 2,
      	"maxWidth": 1280,
      	"maxHeight": 720,
      	"maxFPS": 30,
      	"vcodec": "h264_omx"            
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If the option is missing, it defaults to false, and does not enable the uploader.

* For the setup of Google Drive, please follow the Google Drive Quickstart for Node.js instructions from here except for these changes.
