Because many cameras do not natively support MQTT or HTTP calls in the format Homebridge Camera FFmpeg uses, additional plugins have been written by various developers to add support for methods used by various cameras. 

#### Helper Plugins

- [homebridge-ftp-motion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-ftp-motion) by Sunoo: Any camera that supports uploading to FTP.
- [homebridge-smtp-motion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-smtp-motion) by Sunoo: Any camera that can send emails over SMTP.
- [homebridge-dahua-alerts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-dahua-alerts) by kushagharahi: Cameras made by Dahua or Lorex.
- [@balansse/homebridge-vivint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@balansse/homebridge-vivint) by balansse: Cameras made by Vivint.

If you know of any additional plugins that add support for other cameras, please [open an Issue](https://github.com/Sunoo/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/issues) and it will be added to this list.
